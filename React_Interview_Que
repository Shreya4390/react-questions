   #  Arrow function
     Arrow functions have a few important distinctions in how they work that distinguish them from traditional functions, as well as a few syntactic enhancements. 
     The biggest functional differences are that arrow functions do not have their own this binding or prototype and cannot be used as a constructor. Arrow functions 
     can also be written as a more compact alternative to traditional functions, as they grant the ability to omit parentheses around parameters and add the concept 
     of a concise function body with implicit return.
